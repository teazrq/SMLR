# `SMLR` Statistical Machine Learning with R

The book is available at https://teazrq.github.io/SMLR/. It is currently serving as textbook and supplementary material for three courses I teach at UIUC:

  * [STAT 432: Basics of Statistical Learning](https://teazrq.github.io/stat432/)
  * [STAT 546: Machine Learning in Data Science](https://teazrq.github.io/stat546/index.html)
  * [STAT 542: Statistical Learning](https://teazrq.github.io/stat542/index.html)
  
This book currently covers the following topics:   

  1. Basic Knowledge
      * R, R Studio and R Markdown
      * Linear regression and linear algebra
      * Numerical optimization basics
  2. Model Selection and Regularization in Linear Models
      * Ridge regression
      * Lasso
      * Spline
  3. Classification models
      * Logistic regression
      * Discriminant analysis      
  4. Nonparametric Models with Local Smoothing
      * K-nearest neighbor
      * Kernel smoothing
  5. Kernel Methods and RKHS
      * Support vector machine
      * RKHS
      * Kernel ridge regression
  6. Tree and Ensemble Models
      * Tree models
      * Random forests
      * Boosting
  7. Unsupervised Learning
      * K-means
      * Hierarchical clustering
